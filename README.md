## :dart: About

During my internship at IBM, I developed a project using IBM Watson Assistant to create an intelligent chatbot. The theme of the project was open-ended, and I chose to address the critical issue of domestic violence against women.

One major challenge faced by victims of domestic violence is the difficulty of communicating their situation discreetly without alerting their abuser. To solve this, I designed a chatbot integrated into a landing page with a pizzeria-themed interface. This design was intentionalâ€”victims could simulate placing a pizza order, allowing them to communicate distress without raising suspicion.

Any information shared through this simulated order would be confidentially forwarded to the police, providing a vital lifeline for those in need of help. This project leverages IBMâ€™s advanced technology while aiming to make a meaningful, real-world impact.
